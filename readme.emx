The enclosed GNU program was ported and compiled using the emx/gcc
compiler kit. A preliminary and modified version based on the beta 0.8d
was used. Over the distributed version 0.8d it included a number of bug
fixes and changes. 

As a result, you may be unable to recompile the enclosed sources with
plain 0.8d or may need to do a few changes or experience strange
behaviour of the compiled programs in some rare cases. With the next
release of emx/gcc, these problems will hopefully disappear.

This archive includes a copy of EMX.DLL, a runtime module of the emx/gcc
system and C library. If you already have a version of it, keep the
newer version of both (it may be wise to keep a backup copy of the older
one too).

In case you have the full emx/gcc package yourself, you may be able to
run the program(s) under plain MS-DOS using the EMX.EXE DOS extender.
This is not supported and completely untested.

The enclosed program(s) and source code is distributed under the GNU
license. The archive includes full source code and a file patches.os2
which documents all changes made to compile it with emx/gcc under OS/2
version 2.0. See the file COPYING for details of the GNU license.

EMX is an environment/toolkit for use of GNU programs under OS/2 2.0,
written by Eberhard Mattes.
